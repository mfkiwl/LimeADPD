The Lime's ADPD-I/Q and ADPD algorithms were implemented in LimeSDR-PCIe-5G and 
LimeSDR-QPCIe boards, respectively. 

The CFR algorithm, which supports the DPD operation, is also implemented on the boards.

The Lime Equaliser algorithm is implemented in LimeSDR-PCIe-5G.

The results of LimeADPD algorithms are presented here.
