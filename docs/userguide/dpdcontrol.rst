DPDcontrol Application
======================

The application DPDcontrol is a command-line application dedicated to LimeSDR QPCIe 
and LimeSDR-PCIe-5G boards. 

Once the test waveforms are played, the ``DPDcontrol`` application can be started.

.. warning::
   It is not allowed to use the DPDcontrol application and LimeSuiteGUI at the 
   same time. Therefore, before starting the DPDcontrol, close the LimeSuiteGUI.

.. note::
   It is possible to linearize PAs using DPDcontrol, and then, after closing
   the DPDcontrol, open LimeSuiteGUI, its DPDViewer window, and check the spectrum
   of the PA output signals. The relevant signal is signal *x* which is a measure of
   PA output.

.. note::
   The LMS#3 is used as DPD monitoring path. 
   Clock for the LMS3 analog interfaces should be set to 61.44 MHz. 
   The clock configuration is provided via LimeSuiteGUI CDCM6208 window.

   * Open Modules → CDCM6208
   * Check the Y6 and Y7 CDCM outputs (for LMS#3 ADCs) in the Frequency planning box.
   * Enter frequency of 61.44 in the Frequency requested boxes. Click Calculate.
   * Click Write All to write the new configuration into the CDCM6208 chip.

.. note:: 
   * open Modules → LMS#1 CFR controls window
   * check boxes: ResetN, LMS1 txen, DPD cap.en., LMS3 mon.path, DPD/CFR enable
   

The very basic DPDcontrol operations are explained through steps 1-7.

1. Open the terminal in following folder, which belongs the *LimeSuiteGUI*
   installation:
   ::

     <LimeSuite install folder>/LimeSuite/src/DPD_CommandMode/
2. Compile the DPDcontrol application:
   ::

     make
3. Start the application with sudo:
   ::

     sudo ./DPDcontrol

.. note::
   If the application *DPDcontrol* is started without any argument, the DPD
   nonlinearity order QADPD_M is defined by the value which is last stored in
   DPDcontrol configuration file. Please, find the description of 
   ``storeConfigDPD`` command below.

.. note::
   If the application is started with an argument, the argument represents the
   DPD nonlinearity order - QADPD_M, which is an integer value in the range from
   1 to 3. This parameter should be stored into DPDcontrol configuration file.
   Use ``storeConfigDPD`` command after DPD is being calibrated. 

4. To calibrate DPD parameters (calculate DPD digital gain and ND delay):
   ::

     calibrateDPD {1, 2, all}

.. note::
   The argument **all** refers to both transmitting channels; available arguments
   are 1, 2 or all, particularly for first channel A, second channel named B, or
   both channels.

.. note::
   Expected values for delay ND are in the range [74 – 80]. 

If in consecutive DPD calibration procedures, different, random values for ND
are obtained, which are out of specified range, there is a RF reflection or
interference. To solve this, check the RF cables. The cable dedicated for DPD
monitoring path (from PA’s coupling output to board) must have strong shield.
Else, place 10dBm-20dBm RF attenuator at board receive port,
dedicated to DPD monitoring input, rather than at PA’s coupling output.

.. note::
   The DPD digital gain should be in range [1.0-3.0], otherwise change the
   LMS7002M receiver gain settings. Open *LimeSuiteGUI*, in tab RFE modify LNA;
   in tab RBB modify PGA gain settings.

.. note:: 
   When running the LTE stack, the DPD calibration procedure requires that the
   data payload is generated by connecting mobile phones to BTS and executing
   MagicIperf application on both phones.

5. When DPD is calibrated, the DPD training operation is started by:
   ::

     startDPD {1, 2, all}

.. note::
   Again, like in previous commands, the argument **all** refers to both
   transmitting channels; available arguments are 1, 2 or all, particularly for
   first channel A, second channel B or both channels.

.. note::
   DPD training operation is performed periodically for both transmitting
   channels, the calculation period is equal to four seconds, just in a few
   iterations PAs get linearized.

.. note::
   The information about DPD calculation errors obtained by DPD training process
   can be useful. The information is displayed or disabled by successive entering
   the character “**l**” in command line.

6. To stop DPD training operation use:
   ::

     stopDPD {1, 2, all}

7. To stop the application:
   ::

     quit

The application *DPDcontrol* has some additional useful commands which are
explained below:

1. The entire command set provided by:
   ::

     help

2. To turn on the DCDCs and PAs (only if  LimeNET internal PAs are used):
   ::

     startDCDC {1, 2, all}
     startPA {1, 2, all}

3. To turn off the DCDCs and PAs (if LimeNET internal PAs are used):
   ::

     stopPA {1, 2, all}
     stopDCDC {1, 2, all}

4. To store the DPD parameters into DPDcontrol configuration file (DPD digital
   gain and ND delay, which are determined by calibrateDPD; and DPD nonlinearity
   order – QADPD_M, defined by *DPDcontrol* application argument), use:
   ::

     storeConfigDPD {1, 2, all}

5. The DPD parameters (*DPD digital gain*, *ND delay* and *QADPD_M*) are loaded
   from configuration file using: 
   ::

     loadConfigDPD {1, 2, all}

.. note::
   When the application *DPDcontrol* is started, the parameters DPD digital gain
   and ND delay are automatically loaded from *DPDcontrol* configuration file.
   Also, when application is started without arguments, the DPD nonlinearity
   order *QADPD_M* is read from configuration file. When it is started with
   argument, it represents value of *QADPD_M*.

6. There is an option to store all calculated DPD coefficients (after training
   process is stopped with *stopDPD* command) into application’s configuration
   file. 
   ::

     storeCoeffDPD {1, 2, all}

7. To read the DPD coefficients from configuration file: 
   ::

     loadCoeffDPD {1, 2, all}

8. To read current status of DPD parameters (*DPD digital gain*, *ND delay* and
   *QADPD_M*), or status of the PAs and DCDCs for both transmitting channels, use
   the following command: 
   ::

     readConfigDPD {1, 2, all}

9. To reset all DPD coefficients:
   ::

     resetDPD {1, 2, all}

.. note::
   The result of this command is the same as DPD is bypassed.
