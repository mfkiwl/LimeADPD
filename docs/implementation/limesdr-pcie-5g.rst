LimeSDR-PCIe-5G Implementation
==============================

LMS1 transmit path
------------------

.. note::

   * LimeADPD I/Q algorithm is implemented via the LimeSDR-PCIe-5G board
   * LimeSDR-PCIe-5G incorporates three transceiver LMS7002M chips, named with LMS1, LMS2, LMS3. 
   * LMS1 is dedicated to 4G LTE signal transmission and LimeADPD I/Q is implemented in its transmit path.
   * Two transmitter channels, named with channels A and B, are implemented by LMS1. 
   * The board integrates TQM8M9079 power amplifiers — which are employed for DPD demonstration — in LMS1 transmit paths.
   * LMS3 is used to implement DPD monitoring paths. 

LimeADPD I/Q and CFR algorithms were implemented using LimeSDR-PCIe-5G board,
a high level block diagram of which is shown in Figure 6. For clarity, Figure 
shows the minimum hardware options required to illustrate the LimeADPD I/Q algorithm. 

The digital circuits implementing LimeADPD I/Q operate at 122.88 MHz clock, 
while its input/output sample rates are 61.44 MS/s. Interpolation block is used to double usual LTE sample rate of 30.72 MS/s before driving DPD block. A DPD sample rate of 61.44 MS/s (or higher) is required if we want to cancel at least IMD3 products in the case of 20 MHz modulation.

The pre-distorter implementation in FPGA is optimized by multiplexing
input data. Namely, the pre-distorter operates at a clock frequency
which is two times greater than the data processing rate.

As shown in Figure 6, frequency conversion from BB to RF is performed by
LMS1 transmitter chains. Frequency down-conversion from RF to BB, which is required for DPD monitoring path implementation, is performed by LMS3 receive chains.

The pre-distorter, ADCs and DACs operate at a rate of 61.44 MHz.The internal LMS7002M on-chip 12-bit DACs are used. The data rate at the *LimeLight* interface is 61.44 MS/s. At the LMS3 receiver side, the chip-external (on-board) 14-bit AD converters are used. 

In order to increase the capacity of the radio link, 2x2 MIMO transceiver is
implemented using LMS1 IC. In each of the transmit channels, separate DPD, 
CFR and low-pass FIR filter blocks were implemented. The LMS1 receive channels are not used for DPD, they are part of 2x2 MIMO receiver. 

The CFR block has provision for changing the number of FIR filter taps *L* in the range 1 ≤ *L* ≤ 40. The 40-tap PWCFR module operates at 122.88 MHz clock frequency. The clipping threshold can be set to 0 ≤ *Th* ≤ 1. The threshold is floating point number. The value of 0 is equivalent to “CFR power down” while 1 corresponds to “CFR bypass”.

CFR output is filtered by on-FPGA digital low-pass post-CFR FIR filters (Figure
6). These filters are very frequency selective and efficiently remove
out-of-band unwanted products generated by BB digital modem, as well as CFR PW
method itself.

The interpolation/decimation option can be enabled or disabled. The choice is
related to the modulation bandwidth as shown later.

If the interpolation control signal is zero (see Figure 6), the data rate of CFR
input signal samples which come (from WFM RAM) to CFR input, is 30.72 MS/s.
Therefore, the PWCFR operates at the clock frequency level which is 4 times
greater than processing data rate. In this case, the data interpolation (using
up-conversion of factor of 2) is used after CFR and post-CFR FIR blocks (see
Figure 6). The number of taps in these filters is 40. The order *L* is in the
range 1 ≤ *L* ≤ 40. 

If the interpolation control signal is equal to one (Figure 6), interpolation (using up-conversion of factor of 2) is used in front of CFR and post CFR FIR blocks. (see Figure 6). In this case, the data rate of signals processed by CFR and post-CFR FIR blocks is equal to 61.44 MS/s. Therefore, the PWCFR operates at the clock frequency level which is only 2 times greater than processing data rate. The data interpolation, located after the CFR and post-CFR FIR blocks, is now bypassed. The number of taps in the CFR and post-CFR low-pass filters is limited to 20. Therefore, the *L* is in the range 1 ≤ *L* ≤ 20.

LMS2 transmit path
------------------

.. note::

   * The CFR algorithm is implemented in LimeSDR-PCIe-5G board LMS2 TX paths.
   * LMS2 is dedicated to 5G signal transmission, having greater bandwidth. 
   * Two 2x2 MIMO transmitter channels, named with channels A and B, are implemented by LMS2.

   Figure 7: CFR implementation in LMS2 path of LimeSDR-PCIe-5G board.

The BB digital modem is implemented by host software which generates waveforms
at rate of 122.88 MS/s. The waveforms are fed to the SDR board through PCIe interface.

The CFR and FIR are implemented in the FPGA. The CFR is based on the Peak Windowing technique.

The interpolation/decimation option can be enabled or disabled. The choice is related to the modulation bandwidth. An oversampling of factor one is used before the CFR block, yielding a maximum data rate of 245.76 MS/s,

The interpolation block is required in order to eliminate unwanted DAC-related signal images in the output signal at antenna point, in the case when signal 
bandwidth is wide, as it is case with 5G signals. 

The interpolation block which doubles the usual 5G signal sample rate of 122.88 MS/s before driving CFR block is specifically designed for 100 MHz bandwidth signals.

The CFR digital circuits, incorporated in LMS2 transmit path, operate at 
245.76 MHz clock signal, while its input/output sample rate is also 245.76 MS/s.  The CFR block has provision of changing the number of FIR filter taps (*L*) in the range 1 ≤ *L* ≤ 32. Besides, the clipping threshold can be set to 0 ≤ *Th* ≤ 1.

The CFR output is filtered by low-pass post-CFR FIR filters (Figure 7). FIR filter is used to eliminate spectrum re-growth produced by BB modem and CFR. The number of taps in post-CFR low-pass filters is limited to 32. The FIR circuits operate at 245.76 MHz clock rate. 

As shown in Figure 7, frequency conversion from BB to RF is performed by
LMS2 LMS7002M transmitter chains. The RFIC-external on-board 16-bit DACs are used and the data rate is 245.76 MS/s.

The 2x2 MIMO transceiver is implemented using LimeSDR-PCIe-5G board LMS2 IC. 
In each LMS2 TX channel, separate interpolation block, CFR and low-pass FIR filter blocks are included.
