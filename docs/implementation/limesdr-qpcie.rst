LimeSDR-QPCIe Implementation
============================

.. note::

   * The LimeADPD algorithm is implemented in LimeSDR-QPCIe board
   * The board LimeSDR-QPCIe incorporates two transceiver LMS7002M chips, named with LMS1 and LMS2. 
     The board is basically dedicated to 4G LTE signal transmission. 
   * The LimeADPD is designed in LMS1 transmit path. Two TX channels, named with channels A and B, 
     are implemented by LMS1. Only one LMS1 receive path is used for realization of both DPD monitoring paths. 

ADPD and CFR algorithms are implemented using LimeSDR-QPCIe board, a high level
block diagram of which is shown in Figure 8. 

LimeSDR-QPCIe board has a lot more options than 
shown (two LMS7002M chips, USB interface, GPS receiver, …).
LMS7002M itself is 2T-2R RF IC. For clarity, Figure shows the minimum hardware
options required to illustrate the LimeADPD implementation. Regarding the
implementation, the same signal names as in Figure 1 are used here.

DPD operates at 122.88 MHz clock while its input/output sample rates are 61.44
MS/s. Interpolation block is used to double usual LTE sample rate of 30.72 MS/s
before driving DPD block. DPD sample rate of 61.44 MS/s (or higher) is required
if we want to cancel at least IMD3 products in case of 20 MHz modulation.

As shown in Figure 8, frequency conversion from BB to RF is performed by
LMS7002M transmitter chains. Frequency down conversion from RF to BB is
implemented by only one LMS7002M receive chain dedicated to ADPD, i.e. one
receiver of the available RF RX chains is allocated as ADPD monitoring path. In
case of MIMO applications, the same ADPD monitoring path is used as time-sharing
resource to linearize multiple PAs which saves power consumption as well as on
board RF resources.

The pre-distorter, external ADCs and DACs operate at rate of
61.44 MHz. Regarding data converters, LMS7002M on chip 12-bit DACs and ADCs are used. The
data rate at *LimeLight* interface is 61.44 MS/s.

In order to increase the capacity of the radio link, 2x2 MIMO transceiver is
implemented. One transceiver IC - the LMS1 is used to implement two MIMO transmitters. In
each of the transmitting channels, separate DPD, CFR and low-pass FIR filter blocks
are designed. Another transceiver IC is used to implement regular MIMO
receivers.

In case of MIMO, single ADPD monitoring path is used as time-shared resource to
linearize multiple PAs which saves power consumption as well as on board RF
resources.

CFR block has provision of changing the number of FIR filter taps *L* in the range 
1 ≤ *L* ≤ 40.

Using the same interface, clipping threshold can be set to 0 ≤ *Th* ≤ 1. It is
floating point number. The value of 0 is equivalent to “CFR power down” while 1
corresponds to “CFR bypass”.

The interpolation/decimation option can be enabled or disabled. The choice is
related to the modulation bandwidth as shown later.

CFR output is filtered by on-FPGA digital low-pass post-CFR FIR filters (Figure
8). These filters are very frequency selective and efficiently remove
out-of-band unwanted products generated by BB digital modem as well as CFR PW
method itself.

We have implemented two CFR blocks for both transmitted channels. The 40-tap
PWCFR module operates at 122.88 MHz clock frequency.  

If interpolation control signal is zero (see Figure 8) the data rate of CFR
input signal samples, which come (from WFM RAM) to CFR input is 30.72 MS/s.
Therefore, the PWCFR operates at the clock frequency level which is 4 times
greater than processing data rate. In this case, the data interpolation (using
up-conversion of factor of 2) is used after CFR and post-CFR FIR blocks (see
Figure 8). The number of taps in these filters is 40. The order *L* is in the
range 1 ≤ *L* ≤ 40. 

If interpolation control signal is equal to one (Figure 8),
interpolation (using up-conversion of factor of 2) is used in front of CFR and
post CFR FIR blocks. (see Figure8). In this case, the data rate of signals
processed by CFR and post-CFR FIR blocks is equal to 61.44 MS/s. Therefore, the
PWCFR operates at the clock frequency level which is only 2 times greater than
processing data rate. The data interpolation, located after the CFR and post-CFR
FIR blocks, is now bypassed. The number of taps in the CFR and post-CFR low-pass
filters is limited to 20. Therefore, the L is in the range 1 ≤ *L* ≤ 20.
